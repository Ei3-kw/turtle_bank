## Summary of idea
### Objective
We're developing an innovative solution that combines artificial intelligence and dynamic programming to create personalized savings plans. Our platform will help users visualize and achieve their financial goals while accounting for factors like inflation.

### Key Features
- AI-driven analysis of user's financial habits and goals
- Dynamic programming algorithm to optimize savings strategies

### TODO
- Customized savings roadmap with clear milestones
- Real-time adjustments based on user behavior and economic factors
- Gamification elements to boost motivation and engagement

### Value Proposition
- For Users - Clear, achievable path to financial goals with built-in motivation
- For Banks - Increased customer engagement and growth in savings deposits

### Inspiration
Kwan came up with the initial idea in the shower. Also Ella struggled with saving due to a lack of clear, motivating goals. This personal experience highlighted the need for a tool that not only plans but also inspires consistent saving behavior.

### Potential Impact
By making saving more accessible and engaging, we aim to improve financial health for individuals while creating new opportunities for banks to attract and retain customers.

### Set Up
**`npm install`**
**`npm install -D tailwindcss`**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

**`npm start`**

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

**`npm test`**

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

**`npm run build`**

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

**`npm run eject`**

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
